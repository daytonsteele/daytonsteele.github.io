I am an Assistant Professor in the [Supply Chain and Operations](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/supply-chain-operations-department) Department at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

My research uses structural estimation and field experiments as techniques to study new innovative processes at retail chains. My works span a variety of retail contexts including apparel, e-Commerce, consumer electronics, and automobile spare parts. 

I received my PhD in Operations at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu), and I completed my undergraduate studies at [University of Richmond](https://www.richmond.edu/), with a BS in Mathematical Economics.

Prior to academia, I worked in management consulting in Richmond, VA, leading the data analytics department.
