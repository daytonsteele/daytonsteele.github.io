I am a PhD student in Operations at the [UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu). My research seeks to understand how an online retailer can utilize creative strategies in interfacing with its customers in an online environment. I focus on empirical approaches, specifically using structural modeling. My advisor is [Saravanan Kesavan](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/saravanan-kesavan/).

When I’m not researching or teaching, I’m spending time with friends and family. I like to explore local culture: you can find me tasting local restaurants, hiking local trails, or attending events.

Prior to academia, I worked in management consulting in Richmond, VA, leading the data analytics department. I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Richmond, with a BS in Mathematical Economics.
