I am a PhD student in Operations at the [UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu). I will be starting this summer as an Assistant Professor in the [Supply Chain and Operations](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/supply-chain-operations-department) Department at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

My research uses structural estimation and field experiments as techniques to study new innovative processes at retail chains. My advisor is [Saravanan Kesavan](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/saravanan-kesavan/).

Prior to academia, I worked in management consulting in Richmond, VA, leading the data analytics department. I completed my undergraduate studies at [University of Richmond](https://www.richmond.edu/), with a BS in Mathematical Economics.
